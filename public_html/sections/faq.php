                    Yes, your information on the OFeX platform is entirely secure. There are 3 levels of security layers that we follow:<br><br>

                    User Authentication: Data can only be viewed by the users after logging in to the application.<br><br>
                    Resource based authorization: This is the second layer of protection offered by the platform. A user can only access information to which he/she is authorized. This ensures that a logged in user can never view or modify the information which belongs to other users of the system.<br><br>
                    User login activity tracking: We store information like “last signed in time”, “IP address of user when they sign in” etc. <br>  <br>               </div>

                    Geofencing is creation of a virtual perimeter that is set around a particular geographical area. The boundary is set such that as and when the vehicle, or  personnel, enters or exits the location, instant alerts are triggered. This will enable the user to discern the exact location the device is at, along with an accurate log of movements made.<br><br>
                    A geofence is curated with the help of GPS, which provides precise location coordinates. In order to set the “fence” around a particular region, you can specify the distance and the diameter as per your business needs.                  </div>

                    We need three points for installation: ignition, power and ground. The ground wire is connected to the metal body of the vehicle. Power and ignition are taken from coupler without cutting the wires. In case of vehicles where OBD port is available, we use OBD extension to install the device.                  </div>

                    In case of a wired device, it takes less than 3 Hours for installation of fuel sensors and 20 mins for GPS Terminal. For OBD devices, the installation process is less than a minute, since it is simply a plug and play device.                  </div>
